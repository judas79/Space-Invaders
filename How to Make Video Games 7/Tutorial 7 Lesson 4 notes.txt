In this part of my Video Game Tutorial we completely finish Space Invaders! Well create the Alien AI, Think About when it Makes Sense to Ignore Collisions, 
Randomize AI Firing, Change Images, Hone AI Movement, Make Objects Appear, Randomize Actions, Animate Explosions, Utilize Sound Effects and use StartCoroutine, 
SpriteRenderer, Yield and more.

The Images & Sounds are here. All of the code used follows the video below.

First we will, is double click our Alien script, in Unity and launch the VS editor and go there to write code to our script.
As alway, the notes will be written within the script itself, in the form of comments.

Back in Unity, we will assign all of our Aliens, in our prefab folder, to our Alien tag as well as our Alien layer, in their drop downs, 1 alien at a time.
Next, verify that the prefab 'Shield' has its tag and layer, set to Sheild.

Next lets click Edit, Project Settings, Physics 2D, and make sure the Alien row does not intersect with the Sheild column.  Uncheck it if they intersect, 
at the intersecting point.

Next go back to out Alien.cs script in the VS editor and complete the script and note documentation.

Next,back in the Unity game editor, we will assign all the things we completed in the script.

First, we will assign a tag and a layer name for AlienBullet in our Prefab folder; the name of: AlienBullet
add tag, then the + sign AlienBullet, in layers, add layer, user layer 13 AlienBullet
Then choose AlienBullet in Prefab and select AlienBullet, from the tab and layers dropdowns.

Next, Edit, Project Settings, Physics 2D, make the AlienBullet and the Alien to ignore eachother, by removing the check mark,
where the two intersect.
Also, make AlienBullet ignore the other AlienBullet in the physics 2D grid.

Next we will set up all our Aliens, with components.  
We will first add a RigidBox to all of our aliens one Alien at a time,
by selecting the Alien in Prefab the Add Component, Physics 2d, RigidBody 2D
Universal Settings for all Aliens for RigidBody 2D
Mass = 0.0001
Gravity Scale = 0
Collision Detection = Constinuous
Interpolate = Interpolate
Freeze Rotation Z Checked

Then we can add component, Physics 2D, Box Collider; add one for each alien
leave the settings as they are.

Next, we will put our Alien script in each of our Aliens, by dragging Alien from our scripts folder,
down below our add Component button, and dropping them there for each alien.

In the settings script area, for each Alien, drag the AlienBullet, from the Prefab section,
and drop it in the Alien Bullet space, in the script part of the settings, area.

Next, we will fill in the rest of the settings area, for each alien, in the prefab folder.

Alien2 Alien(Script) settings:
Start Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_1 (in sprites folder)
Alt Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_2 (in sprites folder)
Exploded Ship Image:  SpaceInvadersSprite_7 (in sprites folder)

Alien3 Alien(Script) settings:
Start Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_3 (in sprites folder)
Alt Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_9 (in sprites folder)
Exploded Ship Image:  SpaceInvadersSprite_7 (in sprites folder)

Alien4 Alien(Script) settings:
Start Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_4 (in sprites folder)
Alt Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_10 (in sprites folder)
Exploded Ship Image:  SpaceInvadersSprite_7 (in sprites folder)

Alien5 Alien(Script) settings:
Start Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_5 (in sprites folder)
Alt Image: SpaceInvadersSprite_11 (in sprites folder)
Exploded Ship Image:  SpaceInvadersSprite_7 (in sprites folder)

Next, we will delete all the Aliens, and thier duplicates, from the Main Scene. 
Only the Aliens get deleted.  Leave the Alien, now empty container, there.

Next, drag Alien2, onto the Scene screen, where the first alien on the top left was.
Alien2, will also now appear in the MainScene list, so drag Alien2, into the Aliens folder, in the MainScene list, section.
Then drag 4 more Alien2, into the Alien folder in Main Scene, and drag them into place,
one at a time, as you add them.  
You can use the same value in Each aliens y Position settings, to line them up, in a straight row.
The aliens will manifest themselves, on top of that first, draggrd over alien, 
so it appear to be one, but there are actually two, stack on top of one another.

You should now have 5 aliens, of the same color and number, placed side by side.

Next do the same, adding, Alien3, then Alien4, and Alien5, and you should have this configuration:

_________________________________

Quick note, If all your aliens look lined up nice and straigt, but one of them drrops down a bit when you start the game,
to test it, it could be that the Alien is set to close to the left wall.  Drag it to the right a little bit, and test play it again.
Also, If a whole row of aliens, shows in the Scene window, but dissapeers, when you start the game, check that your,
Start Alien and Alternative Alien settings, still have the dragged in sprites, in those fielsds, as well as the explosion sprite.

Next go into your Alien.cs script and comment out this line:
//SoundManager.Instance.PlayOneShot(SoundManager.Instance.alienBuzz1);
Instead of commenting out the line you can fix it like this:

"I found the solution for anyone who is having problems with SoundManager in Aliens script. 

> Edit > Project Settings > Script Execution Order

From here hit the '+' button and then click SoundManager
give SoundManager a negative value (-1) and hit Apply

What is happening is that Alien Start() is being called before SoundManager Start() so SoundManager.Instance is null when it is first called in Alien.

The above instructions insures that SoundManager script is run before Alien script"


Then Select, all your wall, one at a time, and change the color from white to black.
