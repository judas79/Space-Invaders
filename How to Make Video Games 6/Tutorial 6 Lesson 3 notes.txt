Welcome to the next to last part of my How to Make Space Invaders tutorial! In this part I’ll cover Sound Effects, Bullets, Making Objects Appear, 
OnTriggerEnter, SoundManager, Changing Scores, SpriteRenderer, Changing Sprites, Destroying Objects, and a bunch of tips on how to avoid mistakes.

The Images & Sounds are here and all the code for the whole series follows after the video below.
http://www.newthinktank.com/wordpress/SpaceInvaderAssets.zip

We will start, by finish up some items in our scripts.  Double click the SpaceShip script, so it opens in VS.
So, now got to the SpaceShip script to see how we added sound, for a bullet shot.

Next, we will highlight our Shield, in our Prefab folder, and then add component and select a box collider 2d.
Box Collider 2d settings:  defaults are good.

Next we will focus on making bullets for our spaceship and for the aliens.
Double click the Bullet script to open in VS.  The notes will continue there.

We are finished with Bullet.cs for now...

Next, within unity, check to see if we have a tag for Shields... Nope...
In prefab, choose Shield and go to the tab area and create a ne tab and name it Shield
Then create a layer for sheild, user layer 12 = Sheild.
Then select Sheild, in the dropdowns for Tag and Layer.

Next, highlight Bullet in Prefab folder.
Drag the ExplodedAlien image in the sprites folder(SpaceInvadersSprites_6), 
into the Bullet script box, where it says 'Exploded Alien Image'

Next verify that the Bullet script is in the SpaceShip: theBullet = Bullet
Check SoundManager to see that it has a lists of sounds; 5 of them.
Its good to occasionally verify that you scripts are set up, where they should be, and not missing.

Next we will create an empty game object, in our heirachy, to put our shield fields in.
Rename it to Shields
Drag Sheild, from prefab into Sheilds, in our hierarchy
Heighlight our Shield in heirarchy and drag the green sheild box, down to the bottom left,
of our Scene screen, above the SpaceShip, and away from the left wall.

After getting the Sheild '@', object in place, duplicate it 3 times, and as your dulicate them, 
line them up side by side in a row, so they are touching, on each inner side.

|
|   @@@@  <----  4 Sheilds
|

| SpaceShip
|_________________________________________

After they are lined up, roughly, in the horizontal plane we can go in to one of the Shield blocks, and copy the Position Y field,
and copy the value.
Next, select all 4 portions of the shield in the Main Scene list, and change all the Position Y fields, to that value.
Select all 4 Shields, duplicate them, drag the 4 duplicates so they touch the top of the original 4 Shields.
Then drag one from each side of the top, and drag them, to the bottom of the, original shields.

|	 @@   <----  2 duplicates sit on top of the original shields
|   @@@@  <----  4 original Sheilds
|   @  @  <----  2 duplicates sit on top of the original shields

Next, select all those shield components in the main scene, and duplicate them, then pull them over 3 more times:

Save Scene!

Next we will set up our AlienBullet script, so double click that to edit in VS;  the notes will continue on the scripts, as comments.

After finishing the AlienBullet script return to Unity.
Select AlienBullet in your Prefab folder, then drag the AlienButton script into the AlienBullet setting, at the bottom, below the add component button.

Next, in the AlienBllet setting, drag the Exploding bullet which is named "SpaceInvadersSprites_7", in our sprites folder, into our AlienBullet script,
and put it in the 'Exploted Ship Image' field.
